# S4OQ

## Basic approach

- Upscaling all textures by 2
- replacing all textures with high res versions as close as possible to originals. Yes, even the Shoalin Cyborgs Vs Ninja Pirates VII poster!
- If deviating from original then honour the colour, saturation, brightness and general feel
- virtually nothing in S4TSS is clean and new, so some dirt and wear is required
- Be aware and preserve original alpha channel; it appears to be used for opacity, reflection, highlights and illumination. If the texture changes then the alpha channel may need changing too.
