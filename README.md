# S4OQ

## Basic approach

- Upscaling all textures by 2
- replacing all textures with high res versions as close as possible to originals. Yes, even the Shoalin Cyborgs Vs Ninja Pirates VII poster!
- Honour the colour, saturation, brightness and general feel of the original
- Keep the dirt and wear from the original
- Preserve, or reproduce original alpha channel
- Perhaps be a little subtler with the normal maps than the originals
